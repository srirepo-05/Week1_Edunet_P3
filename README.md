# Week1_Edunet_P3
This is the week1 update on my Project, Predicting Solar Power Output using Linear Regression

Week1 summary:

In the Week 1 of the project, I performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and prepare it for model development.

Key tasks accomplished :
1)The dataset was loaded, and it was analyzed using methods  .shape, .describe()
2) Check for missing values and duplicates, indicating no missing or duplicate entries.
3)A histogram was plotted to examine the distribution of the target variable, generated_power_kw
**IMPROVEMENTS:**
4)A correlation matrix heatmap was created to find the relationships between features.
5)Highly correlated feature pairs were extracted and printed.
